There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.
You do no find the happy life. You make it.
The most wasted of days is one without laughter.
Stay close to anything that makes you glad you are alive.
Make each day your masterpiece.
Happiness often sneaks in through a door you didn't know you left open.
Happiness is not by chance, but by choice.
Life changes very quickly, in a very positive way, if you let it.
Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see a shadow.
Impossible is for the unwilling.
No pressure, no diamonds.
Believe you can and your're halfway there.
Failure is the condiment that gives success its flavor.
It's never too late to be what you might have been.
When you have a dream, you've got to grab it and never let go.
You must be the change you wish to see in the world.
Stay foolish to stay sane.
Whatever you are, be a good one.
You must do the things you think you cannot do.
Wherever you go, go with all your heart.
Be faithful to that which exists within yourself.
Dream big and dare to fail.
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive.
You are enough just as you are.
To be the best, you must be able to handle the worst.
No matter what you're going through, there's a light at the end of the tunnel.
Every moment is a fresh beginning.
Your mind must be stronger than your feelings.
Life is all about the evolution.
Once you really know yourself, can't nobody tell you nothing about you.
